 # Machine learning and metagenomics identifies uncharacterized taxa inferred to drive biogeochemical cycles in a subtropical hypereutrophic estuary


These R scripts has been designed to :
1. Compute alpha and beta diversity of microbial communities, and correlate with physico-chemical parameters
2. Evaluate functions of the community
3. Identify indicator taxa for nitrates and total phosphorus concentrations
